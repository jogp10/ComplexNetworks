    "# Project: It's Airborne\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, your task is to implement a Susceptible-Infected (SI) disease spreading model and run it on top of a temporal network, built from air transport data that contains departure and arrival times of flights. You'll study the dynamics of spreading and how the outcomes depend on where the process begins as well as the infectivity of the disease, and use static-network centrality measures to understand the roles that specific nodes play.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to returning a short report of your results (including plots and visualizations), also return your commented Python code or notebook (all code related to the project as a single **zip** file). **Always label the axes in your figures!** When reporting your results, remember to answer all questions asked in the exercise sheet. Please note that this notebook contains only the programming tasks of the project, not the questions about interpreting the results. Therefore, before writing your report, consult the exercise sheet available in MyCourses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SI model, each node is either Susceptible (S) or Infected (I). When an Infected node is in contact with a Susceptible node, the Susceptible node may become infected with some probability $p \\in [0, 1]$, reflecting the infectivity of the disease. Infected nodes remain Infected forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our model that mimics the spread of disease through the air transport network, nodes are airports and time-stamped connections are flights between them. Initially, only one airport node (called the _seed_ node) is set to the Infected state, while all other airports are Susceptible. Now, following the SI process, a flight from an Infected source airport infects its Susceptible destination airport with probability $p \\in [0, 1]$. Note that a flight can carry the infection only if its source airport is infected at the time of the flight’s departure! Infected airports remain infected for the rest of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data description\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that are used in the project are available at `/coursedata`. You can also download the data from the course MyCourses page as a `.zip` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The flight data that you will use to perform your simulation are located in the file `events_US_air_traffic_GMT.txt`, where each row contains the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "1st column -> Source [0-278]\n",
    "2nd column -> Destination [0-278]\n",
    "3rd column -> Start Time (GMT) [seconds after Unix epoch time]\n",
    "4th column -> End Time (GMT)\n",
    "5th column -> Duration [Same as (EndTime-StartTime)]\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the information about the airports in file `US_airport_id_info.csv`. `US_air_bg.png` is an image of the USA map used as a background image in some visualizations."

For example, if node $i$ gets infected by a flight arriving from node $j$, you should store the information of $i$ being infected by $j$. This can be done by using a list `trans_nodes`, where `trans_nodes[i] = j`.\n",

For each simulation, record which links are used to infect the yet uninfected airports (either by first infection-carrying flights arriving to susceptible airports or by infecting flights arriving before the already recorded infection time). After running the simulations, compute the fraction of simulations where each link transmitted the disease ($f_{ij}$). For example, if the disease spread from node $a$ to node $b$ in 10 simulations out of 50, $f_{ab} = 0.2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, use the function `plot_network_USA` provided above to visualize the network on top of the US map. Adjust the width of the links according to the fractions $f_{ij}$ to better see the overall structure. Compare your visualization with the maximal spanning tree of the network.\n",
