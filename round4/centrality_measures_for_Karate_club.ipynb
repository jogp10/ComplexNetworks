    "The network captures 34 karate club members and their interactions outside the club. A conflict between \"John A\" (administrator) and \"Mr. Hi\" (instructor) led to the club splitting. Half the members joined Mr. Hi's new club, while the others either found a new instructor or quit karate. Zachary accurately predicted all but one member's group after the split. This network has been regularly used as a benchmark for community detection, something you'll learn about next week. \n",

If there are several shortest paths between a given pair of nodes, the contribution of that pair to the betweenness of $i$ is given by the fraction of those paths that contain $i$. Betweenness scores are normalized by $(N-1)(N-2)$, i.e. the number of node pairs in the network, excluding pairs that contain $i$ because paths starting or ending in node $i$ do not contribute to its betweenness. If $\\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ and $\\sigma_{sit}$ the number of such paths that contain $i$, then\n",

    "Eigenvector centrality is a generalization of degree that takes into account the degrees of the node's neighbors and recursively the degrees of the neighbours of its neighbours, and of the neighbours of the neighbours of the neighbours, and so on.
